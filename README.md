## Inspiration 

For our final Multiverse project, we wanted to tackle something ambitious. This lead us to creating Stuffi, which is 100% created by us. We wrote all our own code, including front-end and back-end and everything in between.

## What It Does

Stuffi allows users to create two basic things: items and tags. From there, the possibilities are endless! Create and assign tags to your items in order to filter and sort in any way you can imagine.

For example, if a user was considering purchasing one of a few different cars, they could use Stuffi to organize their thoughts. They could add the cars they are considering, and then add tags such as Red and Blue for color, and variable tags like the price or MPG. They can then assign these tags to the car items they created (say this car is Red and gets 25 MPG, while this car is Blue but gets 30 MPG). From there, they can filter and sort in a variety of modes based off the assigned tags!

## What's Next 

If we were to continue development on Stuffi, we would like to accomplish the following:
1. Redesign CSS
2. Add collections of items
3. Collaborate with others
4. Introduce a paid plan
